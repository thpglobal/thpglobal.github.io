# Google App Engine

The Hunger Project (thp.org) utilizes GSuite applications to facilitate global collaboration, and so established its custom applications on the Google Cloud Platform - specifically CloudSQL and the Google App Engine (GAE) PHP 8.1 Standard Environment.

Recently, GAE PHP 8.1 Standard Environment became available as PHP 7.4 has reached end of life. 8.1 delivers greater speed but it is much more rigorous about no allowing undefined variables and especially undefined array keys.
