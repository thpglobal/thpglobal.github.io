# Software that empowers the work of ending hunger and poverty

The Hunger Project, a global strategic organization committed to the sustainable end of world hunger, implements programs in more than 16,000 villages worldwide. It required a data system to empowers its staff and volunteers with diverse activity data that could be quickly entered, analyzed and displayed in areas with limited bandwidth.

In general, our software is designed for lightweight, cloud-based, server-side, mobile-friendly database services to support the relatively weak bandwidth and devices in many of the most impoverished communities of our world. They work even better in urban and developed world environments.

Wherever feasible, we seek to make our software available under the Creative Commons and similar licenses.
